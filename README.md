# BookMail - Turn your bookmarks into newsletter
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Note: This is a very early product development, expect some messes here :D 

## Introduction

I am a huge fan of newsletter email! I am usually read articles from my smartphone while commuting. Unfortunately, I found that not too many newsletters that is have a good quality articles for me. On another side, I found some articles shared on Hacker News and (sometimes) Facebook drag my interest. But it is not that easy to turn them into a newsletter.  

The idea is to build an app that mimics Quora's newsletter: personalized newsletter email. There are currently three planned components of this app:

### Webapp

### Analytics Web

### Chrome Extension
